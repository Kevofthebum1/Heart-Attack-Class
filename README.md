# Heart Attack Classification

## About
Heart Attack happens when the blood flow that brings oxygen to the heart is blocked. Researching on this, we see that the dataset has factors that affects heart attack. The factors 
in dataset include smoking, glucose levels, exercise, weight, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels.

## Classification Algorithm Methods
I used different classification methods for our dataset since the target variable, Heart_Attack, uses 0 (No) and 1 (Yes). The classification algorithm methods include:
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Trees Classifier
* K-Nearest Neighbors
* Support Vector Machines
* Random Forest Classifier
* XGBoost Classifier

I also included classification algorithm methods with Hyperparameter Tuning in case of a low accuracy score on the classification algorithm methods.

## Results
Most of classification algorithm methods that I used had an accuracy score of 96%, which meant that there was a high prediction rate on how the factors affected the target variable, Heart_Attack.
